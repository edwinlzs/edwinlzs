### Welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸ‘‹

### I'm Edwin, a final year University student!
- I'm currently focused on learning Frontend Software Engineering.
- However, I also enjoy learning about many other aspects of technology, including Backend Development, Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence.
- I'm mainly looking for job opportunities around Frontend Development, but I am open to opportunities which allow me to improve my software development skills.
